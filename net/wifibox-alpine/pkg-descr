The implementation of the Wifibox embedded wireless router is based on
the use of a Linux-based guest operating system which can communicate
with the host's wireless network card on behalf of the host.  In order
to meet the requirements, this has to be a system with a low resource
footprint and easy to manage.  Alpine Linux is an actively maintained,
security-oriented, lightweight Linux distribution that is based on
musl libc and busybox.
